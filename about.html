          <p>I have a degree in Chemistry/Materials Science from UCLA with a deep love of learning and helping others with my knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>I like to create tools and applications to help people with whatever they need help with. I’m a jack-of-all-trades and I jump at opportunities to learn new things. I believe that having knowledge in a diverse number of fields leads to well-rounded products that anyone can use.
