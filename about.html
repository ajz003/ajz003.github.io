          <p>I was born. This has made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move. Jokes aside, I have been living in California for all my life. I was born in Los Angeles in 1993. I quite enjoy the weather here (plus In-n-Out)!

          <p> In my free time, I like to used to read, write, and play music. I play the piano and dabble in other instruments as well. I have a fascination with learning other languages, and I suppose it's high time I added some more programming languages into the mix!
