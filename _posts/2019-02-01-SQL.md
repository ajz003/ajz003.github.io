### Preface

So, I'm taking a course from Stanford's online Lagunita titled [Databases](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/DB/2014/SelfPaced/about), the self-paced series. the Databases course is comprised of 14 "mini-courses." 

Personally, I'm following their **Relational Databases and SQL: Foundations and Practice** pathway, which includes:

* Introduction and Relational Databases
* Relational Algebra
* **SQL (the topic of this post)**
* Relational Design Theory
* Unified Modeling Language (UML)
* Indexes and Transactions
* Constraints and Triggers
* Views and Authorization
* On-line Analytical Processing
* Recursion in SQL

I'm going to give **a bunch of bullet points** and notes about what I've learned. Here we go!

------
# SQL: Intro

* *"Sequel"* is the "in" pronunciation
* Supported by all major commercial database systems
* Standardized and new features added all the time
* Interactive via GUI or prompt, or embedded in programs
* **Declarative**, based on relational algebra
    * Declarative means you write simple queries that say exactly what you want to get out of the database; you don't have to describe how to get the data out
    * Leads to the "query optimizer," which figures out the fastest way to execute the query on the database

------

### Two parts to the language:

* **Data Definition Language (DDL)**
    * `create table...` `drop table...` etc.
* **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**
    * `select` `insert` `delete` `update` etc.
* Other
    * indexes, constraints, views, triggers, transactions, authorization, etc.

# The Basic SELECT Statement

```sql
Select A1,A2,...,An
From R1,R2,...,Rm
Where condition
```

* **Select**: What to return (3)
* **From**: Relations (1)
* **Where**: Combine filter (2)

**This course uses three relations for its examples:**
1. **College**(cName,state,enrollment)
2. **Student**(sID,sName,GPA,sizeHS)
3. **Apply**(sID,cName,major,decision)

------
## Examples

### Basic 

```sql
select sID, sName, GPA
from Student
where GPA > 3.6;
```

* Gives a table of all students with a GPA greater than 3.6
* **Don't need GPA** in the `select` clause even if we're filtering on the GPA in the `where` clause

------

### Natural join, **select distinct**

```sql
select sName, major
from Student, Apply
where Student.sID = Apply.sID;
```

* **Same as natural join**
* In SQL, we get **duplicates** (mult-set model)...
* Replacing `select` with `select distinct` **removes duplicates!**

------

### Filtering in **where**

```sql
select sName, GPA, decision
from Student, Apply
where Student.sID = Apply.sID
    and sizeHS < 1000 and major = 'CS' and cName = 'Stanford';
```

* **Filters** results based on sizeHS, major, and college applied to

------

### Avoid ambiguous column names

```sql
select distinct College.cName
from College, Apply
where College.cName = Apply.cName
    and enrollment > 20000 and major = 'CS';
```

* **Must specify** `cName` in `select` is `College.cName`

------

### **order by**

```sql
select Student.sID, sName, GPA, Apply.cName, enrollment
from Student, College, Apply
where Apply.sID = Student.sID and Apply.cName = College.cName;
order by GPA desc, enrollment;
```

* SQL is an **unordered** model
* To sort the results, use `order by` (`desc`). `asc` is the default.
* Can `order by` multiple attributes

------

### **like** and **select \***

```sql
select sID, major
from Apply
where major like '%bio%';
```

* `like` utilizes %, _ for pattern matching
* `select *` (select star) returns all attributes

------

### Arithmetic and **as**

```sql
select sID, sName, GPA, sizeHS, GPA*(sizeHS/1000.0) as scaledGPA
from Student;
```

* You can do arithmetic within SQL clauses
* `as` is used to change the labeling of the schema in a query result
