    <p>
    I was born. This has made a lot of people 
    very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move. Jokes aside, I 
    have been living in California for all my life. I was born in Los Angeles in 1993. I quite enjoy the 
    weather here (plus In-n-Out)!

    In my free time, I <del>like to</del> <ins>used to</ins> read, write, and play music. 
    I play the piano and dabble in other instruments as well. I have a fascination with 
    learning other languages, and I suppose it's high time I added some programming languages 
    into the mix!
